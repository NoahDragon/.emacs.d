The folder structures:
	Bin --> the executable files which is using (due to git version control, should keep them there)
	Mac --> build under MacOS Mojave (should install llvm using brew install llvm)
	Win --> build under Win10 VS2015 (dependencies are in .emacs.d/thirdparties/win/)

Due to MacOS has the same with the Linux version, so that's why create separate backup folder to distingush them.
