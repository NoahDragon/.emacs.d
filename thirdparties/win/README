Need Manually add the Path to Windows environment.

~~Tried to use "setx" in batch, it could not handle the # of char exceeding 1024, and will truncate.~~
Powershell has command to set the environment variables.

Now, the third parties are managed by scoop.sh, a command line installer for windows.

Please use the init.ps1 script to set up the requirments.
